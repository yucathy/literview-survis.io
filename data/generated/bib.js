        "abstract": "Human milk is the most important way to feed and protect newborns as it has the components to ensure human health. Human Milk Banks (HMBs) form a network that offers essential services to ensure that newborns and mothers can take advantage of the benefits of human milk. Despite this, there is low adherence to exclusive breastfeeding in Brazil, and human milk stocks available in HMBs are usually below demand. This study aimed to co-develop a smart conversational agent (Lhia chatbot) for breastfeeding education and human milk donor recruitment for HMBs. The co-design methodology was carried out with health professionals from the HMB of the University Hospital of the Federal University of Maranh\u00e3o (HMB-UHFUMA). Five natural language processing pipelines based on deep learning were trained to classify different user intents. During the rounds in the co-design procedure, improvements were made in the content and structure of the conversational flow, and the data produced were used in subsequent training sessions of pipelines. The best-performing pipeline achieved an accuracy of 93\\%, with a fallback index of 15\\% for 1851 interactions. In addition, the conversational flow improved, reaching 2904 responses given by the chatbot during the last co-design round. The pipeline with the best performance and the most improved conversational flow were deployed in the Lhia chatbot to be put into production.",

        "abstract": "Background: Depression during pregnancy and in the postpartum period is associated with a number of poor outcomes for women and their children. Although effective interventions exist for common mental disorders that occur during pregnancy and the postpartum period, most cases in low- and middle-income countries go untreated because of a lack of trained professionals. Task-sharing models such as the Thinking Healthy Program have shown great potential in feasibility and efficacy trials as a strategy for expanding access to treatment in low-resource settings, but there are significant barriers to scale-up. We are addressing this gap by adapting Thinking Healthy for automated delivery via a mobile phone. This new intervention, Healthy Moms, uses an existing artificial intelligence system called Tess (Zuri in Kenya) to drive conversations with users. Objective: The objective of this pilot study is to test the Healthy Moms perinatal depression intervention using a single-case experimental design with pregnant women and new mothers recruited from public hospitals outside of Nairobi, Kenya. Methods: We will invite patients to complete a brief, automated screening delivered via text messages to determine their eligibility. Enrolled participants will be randomized to a 1- or 2-week baseline period and then invited to begin using Zuri. Participants will be prompted to rate their mood via short message service every 3 days during the baseline and intervention periods. We will review system logs and conduct in-depth interviews with participants to study engagement with the intervention, feasibility, and acceptability. We will use visual inspection, in-depth interviews, and Bayesian estimation to generate preliminary data about the potential response to treatment. Results: Our team adapted the intervention content in April and May 2018 and completed an initial prepilot round of formative testing with 10 women from a private maternity hospital in May and June. In preparation for this pilot study, we used feedback from these users to revise the structure and content of the intervention. Recruitment for this protocol began in early 2019. Results are expected toward the end of 2019. Conclusions: The main limitation of this pilot study is that we will recruit women who live in urban and periurban centers in one part of Kenya. The results of this study may not generalize to the broader population of Kenyan women, but that is not an objective of this phase of work. Our primary objective is to gather preliminary data to know how to build and test a more robust service. We are working toward a larger study with a more diverse population.

        "abstract": "Background In recent years, expectant and breastfeeding mothers commonly use various breastfeeding-related social media applications and websites to seek breastfeeding-related information. At the same time, AI-based chatbots-such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot-have become increasingly prevalent on these platforms (or on dedicated websites), providing automated, user-oriented breastfeeding guidance. Aim The goal of our study is to understand the relative performance of three AI-based chatbots: ChatGPT, Gemini, and Copilot, by evaluating the quality, reliability, readability, and similarity of the breastfeeding information they provide. Methods Two researchers evaluated the information provided by three different AI-based breastfeeding chatbots: ChatGPT version 3.5, Gemini, and Copilot. A total of 50 frequently asked questions about breastfeeding were identified and used in the study, divided into two categories (Baby-Centered Questions and Mother-Centered Questions), and evaluated using five scoring criteria, including the Quality Information Provision for Patients (EQIP) scale, the Simple Measure of Gobbledygook (SMOG) scale, the Similarity Index (SI), the Modified Dependability Scoring System (mDISCERN), and the Global Quality Scale (GQS). Results The evaluation of AI chatbots\u2019 answers showed statistically significant differences across all criteria (p {\\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Copilot scored highest on the EQIP, SMOG, and SI scales, while Gemini excelled in mDISCERN and GQS evaluations. No significant difference was found between Copilot and Gemini for mDISCERN and GQS scores. All three chatbots demonstrated high reliability and quality, though their readability required university-level education. Notably, ChatGPT displayed high originality, while Copilot exhibited the greatest similarity in responses. Conclusion AI chatbots provide reliable answers to breastfeeding questions, but the information can be hard to understand. While more reliable than other online sources, their accuracy and usability are still in question. Further research is necessary to facilitate the integration of advanced AI in healthcare.",

Quality improvement interventions require the identification of the factors influencing hospital benchmark indicators. Machine Learning (ML) models and post-hoc Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques allow accurate predictions and explaining them. This study aimed to predict exclusive breastfeeding during the in-hospital postpartum stay by ML algorithms and explain the ML model's behaviour to support decision making. METHODS: The dataset included 2042 mothers giving birth in 18 hospitals in Eastern Spain. We obtained information on demographics, mothers' breastfeeding experiences, clinical variables, and participating hospitals' support conditions. The outcome variable was exclusive breastfeeding during the in-hospital postpartum stay. We tested algorithms from different ML families. To evaluate the ML models, we applied 10-fold stratified cross-validation. We used the following metrics: Area under curve receiver operating characteristic (ROC AUC), area under curve precision-recall (PR AUC), accuracy, and Brier score. After selecting the best fitting model, we calculated Shapley's additive values to assign weights to each predictor depending on its additive contribution to the outcome and to explain the predictions. RESULTS: The XGBoost algorithms showed the best metrics (ROC AUC",

        "abstract": "Social media is a growing platform for health-related discourse, opinion and experience sharing, including breastfeeding. For instance, nursing mothers share their personal experiences and opinions about breastfeeding on social networks, such as Facebook and Twitter. Unravelling the sentiments behind these experiences will promote adequate knowledge of many challenges, benefits, and factors influencing breastfeeding behaviours. To achieve this, we mine breastfeeding-related tweets and then perform sentiment analysis of the tweets using lexicon-based and machine learning (ML) techniques with the aim of detecting their sentiment polarity (i.e., positive or negative). Specifically, we implement and compare four lexicon-based sentiment classifiers, as well as five ML-based classifiers. Our results show that VADER-EXT (our extended version of VADER) performed best with an overall F1-score of 82.4\\%, compared to the other lexicon-based classifiers. On the other hand, Support Vector Machine (SVM) outperformed the other four ML-based classifiers with an overall F1-score of 73.7\\%. The overall best performing classifier is then used in determining the sentiment polarity of tweets. Next, we conduct thematic analysis of both positive and negative tweets to identify the factors influencing breastfeeding behaviours either positively or negatively. Our findings reveal various health-related factors (such as lactational issues, medical issues, and nutritional issues), social factors, psychological factors, and situational factors affecting breastfeeding behaviours negatively. Also, perceived benefits, maternal self-efficacy, social support, and education and training support emerged as the positive factors influencing breastfeeding behaviours. Finally, we reflect on our findings and recommend interventions that address the negative factors to promote positive breastfeeding behaviours.",
